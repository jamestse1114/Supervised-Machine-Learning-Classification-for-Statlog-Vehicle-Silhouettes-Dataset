# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Classification-for-Statlog-Vehicle-Silhouettes-Dataset

This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on supervised machine learning tasks using the Statlog (Vehicle Silhouettes) dataset. This dataset includes attributes of real-world images of various vehicles, and the objective is to categorize these vehicles based on their silhouettes.

## Project Description

The project applies several machine-learning techniques to classify the vehicles in the dataset. These techniques include Decision Trees, Instance-based Learning, Neural Networks, Bayesian Learning, and Model Ensembles. The performance of these models is measured using accuracy and precision metrics.

## Dataset

The Statlog (Vehicle Silhouettes) dataset consists of 18 unique features, each describing a different aspect of a vehicle's silhouette. These features provide rich information to help train machine learning models to recognize multiple patterns and make accurate predictions.

## Methodology

The approach to this project involves:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** This step includes removing any empty values and encoding any categorical factors.
2. **Feature Selection:** A subset of the most significant features for classification is chosen using statistical techniques like principal component analysis, feature significance ranking, and correlation analysis.
3. **Visual Analysis:** The images of the vehicle silhouettes in the dataset are manually inspected to identify any visible patterns.
4. **Supervised learning:** The machine learning approaches are utilized to test and classify the dataset, and metrics are compared to evaluate the effectiveness of the methods.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following Python libraries:

1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. scikit-learn
5. Keras
6. seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip.
